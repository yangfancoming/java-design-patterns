/**
 * 
 * Composition over inheritance. The Bridge pattern can also be thought of as two layers of abstraction.
 * With Bridge, you can decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
 * <p>
 * In Bridge pattern both abstraction ({@link Weapon}) and implementation (
 * {@link Enchantment}) have their own class hierarchies. The interface of the implementations
 * can be changed without affecting the clients.
 * <p>
 * In this example we have two class hierarchies. One of weapons and another one of enchantments. We can easily
 * combine any weapon with any enchantment using composition instead of creating deep class hierarchy.
