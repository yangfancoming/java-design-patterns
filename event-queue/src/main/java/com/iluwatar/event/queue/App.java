/**
 * Event or message queues provide an asynchronous communications protocol, meaning that the sender
 * and receiver of the message do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time. 
 * Events or messages placed onto the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves them. Event 
 * or message queues have implicit or explicit limits on the size of data that may be transmitted
 * in a single message and the number of messages that may remain outstanding on the queue.
 * A queue stores a series of notifications or requests in first-in, first-out order.
 * Sending a notification enqueues the request and returns. The request processor then processes
 * items from the queue at a later time.
